## FreeBSD desktop setup script!

This is supposed to make your life easier for new FreeBSD installs, this is mainly a way for me to learn the the internals of FreeBSD

!DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPTS! without reading them and understanding what they do, do not trust random scripts you find on the internet.

What needs to be done:
- [X] Switch pkg over to latest branch, auto update & upgrade
- [X] Install Xorg and add the user to video group
- [X] Script to add tools to the userland of FreeBSD
- [ ] Setup desktop script which installs everyhing you need for a FreeBSD desktop
